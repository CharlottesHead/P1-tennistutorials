            <h2>Preperation</h2>
            <p>When the ball is in the air and flying in your direction, turn your upper body to the Right. At this moment, you stretch your right arm (if you are right handed) halfway with the racket.

                Turn your left arm until it is parallel to the baseline. Your left shoulder then points towards the ball. In addition,  you should bend your knees slightly to build up energy. Keep your eyes on the ball at all times during the whole process. Start your back swing high, bringing the racket past your face and then in one fluid motion drop it down low to around knee height and start bringing the racket foward to meet the ball. At this point your hand should have made somewhat of a semi-circle shape. This motion will allow you to generate much more power and topspin than if you were to just take your hand back then forth in two stright lines.</p>

                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>Now your racket is moving forward on its way to making contact with the ball! Your racket should be moving upwards as well as forward to complete the circle you started in the preparation/backswing. Contact with the ball should be made in front of you. It is natural  for a beginner to want to wait until the ball is passing them before hitting it, but there is a long list of reasons why it's better to hit the ball early, so it's good to get In that habit as soon as possible.<br></p>

                <h2>Follow Though</h2>
                <p>"Put it in the backpack!" is the proverb that I was taught early on regarding where the racket should go after contact, and it still stands true today. Aiming to finish your stroke in the right place will help ensure that the racket followed the correct path throughout the entire swing. In turn this will make some of the steps I've mentioned come much more naturally and without having to think too much about it.</p>
